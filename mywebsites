Louise, 
when the agent, instead of any or none etc, it is Docker, what  does it mean?, eg
pipeline {
    agent { docker { image 'maven:3.3.3' } }
    stages {
        stage('build') {
            steps {
               bat label: '', script: 'mvn --version'
            }
        }
    }
}

what does this mean? Please advise
