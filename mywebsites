also note that carassembly2 =  we added environment for the first time. check the pipeline level environment and stage level one.
Louise, 
when the agent, instead of any or none etc, it is Docker, what  does it mean?, eg
pipeline {
    agent { docker { image 'maven:3.3.3' } }
    stages {
        stage('build') {
            steps {
               bat label: '', script: 'mvn --version'
            }
        }
    }
}

what does this mean? Please advise
